## Introduction

This is an example of using `RStudio`, `knitr` and `R Markdown` to author data
analysis reporting.

The definitive guide to R Markdown can be found here:

For a quick reference, see this cheatsheet:

## Inspect directory

Find out the current directory:

```{r}
getwd()
```

Check folders and files in the data directory:

```{r}
dir(path = "~/Documents/r-courses/data", recursive = TRUE)
```

## Import data

Import `airline-safety.csv`:


```{r}
library(readr)
airline_safety <- read_csv("~/Documents/r-courses/data/data_import/airline-safety.csv")
```

Check data structure:

```{r}
str(airline_safety, give.attr = FALSE)
```

Print out the first four columns:

```{r}
knitr::kable(airline_safety[, 1:4])
```
